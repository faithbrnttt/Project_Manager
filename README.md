# Overview

The **Project Manager App** is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, organize, and track development projects in one centralized interface.

This project demonstrates key full-stack development concepts including:

• REST API design  
• frontend UI architecture  
• database integration  
• image storage and uploads  
• project and task management workflows  

The application was designed to simulate the type of internal tools teams use to manage development projects.

---

# System Architecture


Frontend (React)
↓
Backend API (Node / Express)
↓
Database (MongoDB)


The application follows a **typical MERN-style architecture** separating frontend UI, backend logic, and persistent storage.

---

# Key Features

### Project Management

Users can:

• create projects  
• update project details  
• delete projects  
• attach descriptions and technologies  
• add links to code repositories and live apps  

---

### Image Upload Support

Projects can include screenshots or preview images.

Images are stored using **cloud storage integration** and displayed in the application UI.

---

### REST API Backend

The backend service handles:

• project CRUD operations  
• file uploads  
• request validation  
• database interactions  

---

### Responsive UI

The frontend interface allows users to quickly view and manage projects with a clean, responsive layout.

# Installation

### Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/faithbrnttt/Project-Manager.git

cd Project-Manager


---

### Install dependencies

Install frontend dependencies


cd client
npm install


Install backend dependencies


cd ../server
npm install


---

# Running the Application

### Start the backend server


cd server
npm run dev


---

### Start the frontend


cd client
npm run dev


The app will start locally and connect the frontend to the API server.

# Example Project Object

Example JSON structure used by the API:


{
"title": "Hospital Integration Simulator",
"description": "Simulates healthcare device workflows",
"technologies": ["Python", "PostgreSQL", "Flask"],
"codeUrl": "https://github.com/example/repo
",
"appUrl": "https://example.com
",
